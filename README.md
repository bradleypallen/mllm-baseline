# TREC 2025 Million LLMs Track - Random Forest Regressor Baseline

A machine learning framework for ranking Large Language Models (LLMs) by predicted expertise on user queries, developed for the [TREC 2025 Million LLMs Track](https://trec-mllm.github.io/) as a baseline for understanding how to approach the task.

## Experimental Overview

**Problem Statement**: Given a user query, predict and rank 1,131 LLMs by their ability to provide high-quality answers without actually querying the models.

**Approach**: This baseline implementation uses supervised learning with Random Forest Regression, combining TF-IDF query features and LLM identity encoding to predict relevance scores, validated through 10-fold cross-validation.

**Baseline Purpose**: This framework establishes performance benchmarks for comparison with more advanced models under development. The approach prioritizes reproducibility and interpretability over optimization.

**Data Scope**: This experiment uses only the development dataset (342 queries with ground truth relevance judgments). The discovery dataset (14,950 queries) is not utilized in this baseline implementation.

## Dataset and Data Ingestion

### Source Data
- **Development Queries**: 342 queries from `data/llm_dev_data.tsv` (used in this baseline)
- **Relevance Judgments**: 386,802 query-LLM pairs from `data/llm_dev_qrels.txt` (used in this baseline)
- **Discovery Queries**: 14,950 queries with LLM responses (not used in this baseline implementation)
- **Ground Truth Labels**: Three-level relevance scale (0=not relevant, 1=most relevant, 2=second most relevant)

### Data Distribution
- **Class Imbalance**: 92.4% non-relevant (0), 3.7% most relevant (1), 3.8% second most relevant (2)
- **Coverage**: Complete relevance judgments for all 342 queries × 1,131 LLMs = 386,802 examples
- **Quality**: No missing values, consistent formatting across all entries

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
```bash
python create_supervised_training_set.py
```

**Preprocessing Steps**:
1. **Query Text Integration**: Join development queries with relevance judgments by query_id
2. **Target Normalization**: Convert qrel scores to [0,1] interval (0→0.0, 1→0.5, 2→1.0)
3. **Feature Matrix Creation**: Combine TF-IDF text features with label-encoded LLM identifiers
4. **Training Set Generation**: Output 386,802 examples to `data/supervised_training_full.csv` with query_text, llm_id, and normalized qrel columns

## Model Architecture

### Model Type: Random Forest Regressor

**Architecture Configuration**:
- **Estimators**: 100 decision trees
- **Max Depth**: 15 levels to balance expressiveness and overfitting prevention
- **Min Samples Split**: 5 examples required for internal node splits
- **Min Samples Leaf**: 2 examples required at terminal nodes
- **Parallelization**: Multi-threaded training with n_jobs=-1

### Feature Engineering

**Text Features (TF-IDF Vectorization)**:
- **Dimensionality**: 1,000 features maximum
- **N-gram Range**: Unigrams and bigrams (1,2) for semantic richness
- **Preprocessing**: English stop word removal, minimum document frequency = 2
- **Output**: Sparse matrix of normalized term frequencies capturing query semantics

**LLM Identity Features**:
- **Encoding**: Label encoding of LLM identifiers (llm_0000 → 0, llm_0001 → 1, ...)
- **Purpose**: Enable model to learn relative performance patterns across LLMs
- **Integration**: Single additional feature column appended to TF-IDF matrix

**Regression Objective**:
- **Target**: Continuous relevance scores in [0,1] interval
- **Loss Function**: Mean squared error minimization
- **Prediction Clipping**: Outputs bounded to [0,1] range
- **Ensemble Averaging**: Final predictions from mean of 100 tree outputs

### Training Strategy

**Supervised Learning Framework**:
- **Data Split**: Query-based partitioning to prevent information leakage
- **Cross-Validation**: 10-fold stratified by unique queries (not examples)
- **Training Objective**: Learn query-LLM relevance mapping from labeled examples
- **Hyperparameters**: Fixed configuration optimized for ranking performance

## Experimental Design: 10-Fold Cross-Validation

### Validation Methodology
```bash
python train_full_cv_simple_progress.py
```

**Cross-Validation Protocol**:
- **Splitting Strategy**: Partition 342 unique queries into 10 folds (~34 queries per fold)
- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure no query appears in both train and test within same fold
- **Training Set**: ~90% of queries (~308 queries, ~348,000 examples per fold)
- **Test Set**: ~10% of queries (~34 queries, ~38,000 examples per fold)

**Model Training Process**:
1. **Feature Creation**: Fit TF-IDF vectorizer and LLM encoder on training queries
2. **Model Fitting**: Train Random Forest on ~348,000 training examples (~11 minutes per fold)
3. **Prediction**: Generate relevance scores for ~38,000 test examples
4. **Evaluation**: Calculate nDCG@10 and MRR metrics on test queries

### Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics (TREC Standard)**:
- **nDCG@10**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank 10
- **MRR**: Mean Reciprocal Rank of first relevant LLM

**Metric Calculation**:
1. **Query-Level Grouping**: Group predictions by query_id for ranking evaluation
2. **LLM Ranking**: Sort LLMs by predicted relevance scores (descending)
3. **Relevance Mapping**: Use ground truth qrel scores for gain calculation
4. **Aggregation**: Compute mean performance across all test queries
